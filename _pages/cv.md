#### Education
- **Cornell University**  
  *Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering*  
  GPA: 4.12/4.30| Graduation: May, 2026

---

#### Skills
- **Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor, ANSYS  
- **Programming:** MATLAB  
- **Tools:** 3D Printing, Mill, Lathe

#### Work Experience
- **Physical Sciences Inc. - Deployable Technologies Intern**  
  [June, 2025] - [August, 2025]  
• Designed and iterated on a quick-release gripper using SolidWorks and 3D-printed prototypes, each capable
of supporting 165 lbs. and integrated into a rescue litter carry device intended for long-distance transports.
• Demonstrated satisfaction of gripper’s design requirements through experimental tests and finite element
analysis (SolidWorks simulation) with mass-production gripper material.
• Integrated sensors to test fuel pump intended for use with low lubricity fluids.
• Assisted in ideation of mobile lightweight folding bridge that can deploy and be retrieved in under
5 minutes and span a 15-meter gap while maintaining a load of 60 tons.

#### Extracurricular Activities

- **Cornell Mars Rover Project Team - Lead, Arm sub-team**
  [October, 2022] - Present 
• Designed end effector and structural joints for a six-axis robotic manipulator assigned to perform complex
tasks including typing, flipping switches, picking up rocks, and securing a door with a screw.
• Successfully reduced moment on the base gearbox by 12 percent through shifting gearbox and motor
locations in the arm’s structure.
• Utilized finite element analysis (ANSYS) to demonstrate that arm CNC joints can sustain loads up to 5 kg.
• Added functionality to end effector to fasten a screw, creating rotation and linear motion in one mechanism.
